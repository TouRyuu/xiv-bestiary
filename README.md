# xiv-bestiary
A Bestiary website for FFXIV Online, built with Next.js, and utilizing XIVAPI (xivapi.com)

It is currently unfinished, as most of the data needs to be put in by hand. The following is a list of features which I still need to implement for basic functionality, or would like to implement in the future.

- Expand my use of XIVAPI to include using the Content Links for obtaining Hunting Log and Hunt Bills data.
- Implement a data storage system for use in a final product to store extra data, which would be put in through the site by a person.
- Monster Page Editing: Adding editing to each monster page would allow me to easily add data to my data storeage system. I would prefer for each item to be its own edit, rather than editing the whole page.

This data site was built as a sample/practice project. It is in no way complete; there are many things I still wish to accomplish. However, I have reached a point where working on this becomes faster, but the rate at which I learn things slows down. As such, I am temporarily moving on to a different project so I can learn more as quickly as possible. When I return to this project, I will either resume where I left off or rebuild it into something even better. I am looking forward to getting back to this once I have some other prototypes or full projects completed!

If you have any questions about this project, please feel free to contact me.
